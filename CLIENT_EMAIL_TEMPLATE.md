**Subject:** That AI tool we mentioned - it's ready

---

Hi [Name],

Remember we talked about using AI to test messaging before campaigns go live? Well, it's built and working.

## What we've got

Basically, we can now upload your content and get instant feedback from AI versions of your target audience - CIOs, CFOs, CMOs, whoever you're trying to reach. No more guessing if messaging will work.

## Here's what it does

**AI Persona Testing** (the main thing)
- Upload any marketing copy
- Pick who you're targeting (CIOs, CFOs, whatever)
- Get back exactly what they'd think, their objections, how likely they are to actually do something

Example: That product launch messaging? We can test it against 7 different decision-makers and know exactly what pushback you'll get before you spend any money.

**Interview Analysis**
Got a pile of customer interviews? Upload them all and it'll tell you the common themes automatically. Saves hours of manual work.

**Content Scoring**
Upload anything - website copy, proposals, whatever - and get a quality score plus specific suggestions to make it better.

**Competitive Analysis**
See how similar your messaging is to competitors and find gaps where you can differentiate.

**Plus a few other bits:**
- Messaging frameworks (structured positioning stuff)
- Custom analysis (ask it anything about any document)

## Why this actually matters

Look, we can test stuff before we spend money on it. That's basically it.

Instead of launching a campaign and hoping it works, we know upfront what people will think. Takes minutes instead of weeks of research.

## Getting Started

The platform is live and ready to use. Here's how to get started:

1. **Access the platform** at [your-platform-url]

## What You'll Need

## Support

I'm here to help you get the most value from the platform:

## Next Steps

I'd love to schedule a brief call to show you the platform in action with your actual content. When would be a good time this week for a 20-minute demonstration?

The platform represents our commitment to bringing cutting-edge AI capabilities to strategic marketing work. I'm confident it will transform how you approach content development and campaign planning.
